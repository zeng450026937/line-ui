# Range

The Range slider lets users select from a range of values by moving
the slider knob. It can accept dual knobs, but by default one knob
controls the value of the range.

### Range Labels

Labels can be placed on either side of the range by adding the
`slot="start"` or `slot="end"` to the element. The element doesn't have to
be an `line-label`, it can be added to any element to place it to the
left or right of the range.
