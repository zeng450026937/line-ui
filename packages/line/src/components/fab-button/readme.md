# FabButton

Floating Action Buttons (FABs) represent the primary action in an application. By default, they have a circular shape. When pressed, the button may open more related actions. As the name suggests, FABs generally float over the content in a fixed position. This is not achieved exclusively by using an `<line-fab-button>FAB</line-fab-button>`. They need to be wrapped with an `<line-fab>` component in order to be fixed over the content.

If the FAB button is not wrapped with `<line-fab>`, it will scroll with the content. FAB buttons have a default size, a mini size and can accept different colors.
