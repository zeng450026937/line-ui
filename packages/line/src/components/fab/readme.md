# Fab

Fabs are container elements that contain one or more fab buttons. They should be placed in a fixed position that does not scroll with the content. Fab should have one main fab-button. Fabs can also contain fab-lists which contain related buttons that show when the main fab button is clicked. The same fab container can contain several `fab-group` elements with different side values.
