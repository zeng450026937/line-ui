# Reorder

Reorder is a component that allows an item in a group of items to be dragged to change its order within that group. It must be used within an `line-reorder-group` to provide a visual drag and drop interface.

`line-reorder` is the anchor used to drag and drop the items inside of the `line-reorder-group`. See the `Reorder Group` for more information on how to complete the reorder operation.
