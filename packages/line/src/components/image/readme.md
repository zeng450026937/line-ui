# Image

Img is a tag that will lazily load an image when ever the tag is in the viewport. This is extremely useful when generating a large list as images are only loaded when they're visible. The component uses [Intersection Observer](https://caniuse.com/#feat=intersectionobserver) internally, which is supported in most modern browser, but falls back to a `setTimeout` when it is not supported.
