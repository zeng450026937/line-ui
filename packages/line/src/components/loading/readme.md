### Dismissing

The loading indicator can be dismissed automatically after a specific amount of time by passing the number of milliseconds to display it in the `duration` of the loading options. To dismiss the loading indicator after creation, call the `dismiss()` method on the loading instance. The `onDidDismiss` function can be called to perform an action after the loading indicator is dismissed.
