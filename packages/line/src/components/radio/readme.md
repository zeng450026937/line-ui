# Radio

Radios should be used inside of an `line-radio-group`. Pressing on a radio will check it. They can also be checked programmatically by setting the value property of the parent `line-radio-group` to the value of the radio.

When radios are inside of a radio group, only one radio in the group will be checked at any time. Pressing a radio will check it and uncheck the previously selected radio, if there is one. If a radio is not in a group with another radio, then both radios will have the ability to be checked at the same time.
