# Datetime

Datetimes present a picker interface from the bottom of a page, making it easy for
users to select dates and times. The picker displays scrollable columns that can be
used to individually select years, months, days, hours and minute values. Datetimes
are similar to the native `input` elements of type `datetime-local`, however, Ionic's
Datetime component makes it easy to display the date and time in a preferred format,
and manage the datetime values.
